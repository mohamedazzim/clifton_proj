# RENDER BUILD FIX - Vite Not Found Error

## Issue Identified:
From your Render logs, I can see:
- `vite build && esbuild server/index.ts` - Started
- `ah: 1: vite: not found` - **BUILD FAILED**

This happens because Render can't find the `vite` command in PATH.

## IMMEDIATE FIX:

### Option 1: Update Build Command in Render
In your Render Web Service settings, change the Build Command from:
```
npm install && npm run build
```

To:
```
npm install && npx vite build && npx esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
```

### Option 2: Use Custom Build Script
I've created a `build.sh` script. Change your Render Build Command to:
```
npm install && chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
```

## After Updating:
1. Click "Manual Deploy" in Render
2. Watch logs for successful build
3. Look for: "Build completed successfully!"
4. Test: `https://your-url.onrender.com/api/health`

## Why This Happens:
- `npm run build` calls `vite build` directly
- Render sometimes can't find `vite` in PATH
- `npx vite build` ensures it finds the installed package

Your deployment will work once this build issue is fixed!
