# RENDER DEPLOYMENT FIX GUIDE

## ðŸš¨ Current Issue: 404 API Errors on Render

Your code is working perfectly - I've tested the production build locally and all API endpoints respond correctly with proper data. The issue is Render-specific.

## âœ… Confirmed Working:
- Local development server: All APIs working
- Local production build: All APIs working (tested with NODE_ENV=production)
- Build process: Creates correct dist/index.js and dist/public/ structure
- API responses: Founders, Products, Projects all return correct data

## ðŸ”§ Fix Steps for Render:

### Step 1: Check Render Build Logs
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Check the "Build" section for any errors
4. Look for these success indicators:
   ```
   âœ“ built in XXXs
   dist/index.js XXkb
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Render Configuration
In your Render service settings, ensure:
- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `NODE_ENV` = `production`

### Step 3: Check Service Status
1. In Render dashboard, verify your service status is "Live"
2. Check the "Logs" tab for any runtime errors
3. Look for the startup message: "serving on port XXXX"

### Step 4: Force Redeploy
1. Push a small change to trigger rebuild (like adding a comment)
2. Or use "Manual Deploy" button in Render dashboard

### Step 5: Test After Deploy
Visit your deployed site's `/api-test.html` page to verify APIs work

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Success Signs:
- Render build logs show successful build
- Service status shows "Live"
- API test page shows green checkmarks instead of red X's
- Main website loads with founders and products data

## ðŸ†˜ If Still Not Working:
The issue might be:
- Render service configuration
- Network/firewall issues on Render
- Render platform-specific problems

Try creating a fresh Render service with the same repository and configuration.
